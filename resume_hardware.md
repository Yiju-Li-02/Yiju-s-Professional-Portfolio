## Hardware Engineering Project
*For further insight into my projects, please refer to my website by accessing the [YijuLi.info](https://yijuli.info).*
### MIPS-inspired Microcontroller Design
- Implemented a MIPS-inspired Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) featuring 9-bit instruction length and 16 registers.
- Created a highly efficient and effective assembler program to translate human-readable assembly code into machine code in accordance with the ISA specification.
- Developed the necessary control unit, ALU, and memory components for the ISA using SystemVerilog.
- Conducted thorough testing and verification of the microcontroller design using a custom-designed testbench and Synthesized the SystemVerilog code in Quartus to demonstrate its functionality on hardware.

### Circuit Optimizer
- This is a project focused on optimizing Boolean functions for digital circuit design.
- The project involved taking as input a two-level description of a Boolean function and using a range of algorithms and heuristics to simplify and minimize the function. 

### DSP System Design with VHDL
- Implemented a hardware design of the DSP system, utilizing the VHDL hardware description language.
- Designed and developed the required digital components, such as filters and signal processing blocks, to meet the specific requirements of the system.
- Verified the functionality and performance of the hardware implementation through simulation and testing, ensuring the correct operation of the DSP system.
