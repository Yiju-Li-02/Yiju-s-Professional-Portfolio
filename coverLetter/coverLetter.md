Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position at Zuora. As a student pursuing a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego, I am eager to bring my technical skills and passion for software development to the team at Zuora.

With coursework that has emphasized programming languages, database management, and software engineering, I have developed a strong foundation in software development methodologies and techniques. I am particularly interested in the opportunity to work with databases and databases-related technologies, as I have always been fascinated by the challenge of organizing, storing and retrieving large amounts of data in an efficient manner.

I am confident that my background, enthusiasm and technical skills would make me a valuable addition to the Zuora team. I am eager to bring my passion for software development to the table, and I believe that my education, combined with my strong work ethic and commitment to excellence, will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and to learn more about the Software Engineer Intern role at Zuora.

Sincerely,
Yiju Li
