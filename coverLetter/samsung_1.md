Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in this position at Samsung Semiconductor. I have a strong passion for software development and have been honing my skills in C programming language and multithreading programming over the last few years.

Although I do not have the exact 3+ years of experience developing software applications and GUI applications for Windows as listed in the job requirements, I am confident that my technical skills and drive to learn would make me a valuable asset to the team. I am especially excited about the opportunity to work with C# and cross platform programming.

I have a solid foundation in OOP/OOA concepts and best coding practices, as well as a working knowledge of Linux. I am confident that my ability to quickly learn new technologies and my passion for software engineering would make me a great fit for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how I can contribute to the success of Samsung Semiconductor as an Software Application/Tools Engineer Intern.

Sincerely,  
Yiju Li
