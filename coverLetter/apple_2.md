Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Hardware Technology Intern position at Apple. As a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology and hardware engineering, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

Throughout my studies, I have honed my technical skills in a variety of hardware projects. I have designed and developed a MIPS-inspired microcontroller, optimized Boolean functions for digital circuit design, and implemented a DSP system using VHDL. These projects have allowed me to gain hands-on experience in the design and verification of hardware components and systems, and have given me the skills to work independently and quickly learn new technologies.

In addition to my technical abilities, I am also a strong communicator and team player. I am confident in my ability to collaborate with others to tackle complex problems, and I have excellent interpersonal skills that will allow me to build strong relationships with my colleagues.

I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to Apple, and I am confident that I have what it takes to excel in the Hardware Technology Intern position. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications in an interview.

Sincerely,  
Yiju Li
