"My Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has a 9-bit instruction length and 16 registers, which is designed to mimic the MIPS-like ISA. This ISA specification provides a comprehensive set of instructions and operands that the processor can understand and execute. The ISA design is optimized for performance, power efficiency, and ease of use, and is well-suited for a variety of embedded systems and low-level applications.

To complement the ISA, I developed an efficient and reliable assembler program that can convert human-readable assembly code into machine code according to the ISA specification. The assembler is written in a high-level programming language and uses a well-designed and optimized code structure to ensure the fast and accurate conversion of assembly code into machine code. The output of the assembler is a binary file that can be directly executed by the processor.

This project demonstrates my strong technical skills in low-level systems programming, including my understanding of computer architecture, my ability to design and implement custom ISA, and my proficiency in developing software tools for code generation. It also showcases my dedication to producing high-quality software that meets the needs of the target applications and end-users."

"I successfully completed a project focused on optimizing Boolean functions for digital circuit design. The project involved taking as input a two-level description of a Boolean function and using a range of algorithms and heuristics to simplify and minimize the function. This optimization process aimed to reduce the number of gates required to implement the function and improve the performance of the resulting digital circuit.

During the project, I gained a thorough understanding of Boolean algebra, digital circuit design, and optimization techniques used in hardware synthesis. I applied these concepts by implementing various algorithms and evaluating their effectiveness and trade-offs in different scenarios.

The final outcome of the project was a highly optimized Boolean function with improved performance and reduced gate count. This resulted in a faster and more efficient digital circuit. This project showcases my expertise in digital circuit design, Boolean algebra, optimization, and software programming. It highlights my ability to work with complex digital circuits and apply advanced optimization techniques, as well as my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of the target applications and end-users."

The back-end of the online movie review website was built using the Express.js framework, which is a popular, fast, and flexible Node.js web application framework. To connect the Express.js application to the MySQL database, we utilized the MySQL npm package. This package provided a convenient and efficient way to interact with the MySQL database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations, such as adding and retrieving movie reviews.

In terms of implementation, we created RESTful APIs using Express.js that provided the necessary functionality for the front-end of the website to interact with the back-end and retrieve data from the database. These APIs were built using Express.js route handlers, which enabled us to define the URLs for different resources and how they should be handled. We also used Express.js middleware, such as body-parser, to parse incoming requests and extract the relevant information required for our database queries.

The MySQL database was used to store all the movie reviews along with other relevant information, such as the movie title, review author, and rating. The database was set up with appropriate tables and relationships to efficiently store and retrieve the data. When a user added a new movie review, the front-end sent a POST request to the appropriate Express.js API endpoint, which then processed the request and added the new review to the database. When a user wanted to view movie reviews, the front-end sent a GET request to the appropriate API endpoint, which then retrieved the required data from the database and sent it back to the front-end for display.

This architecture allowed us to create a dynamic, scalable, and efficient online movie review website, where users could add and view movie reviews with ease.


Front-end:
Utilized ReactJS to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface for the online movie review website.
Implemented React components to handle user interactions and update the website in real-time.
Utilized React Hooks to manage the state and lifecycle of the components.
Incorporated styling using CSS to improve the visual appearance of the website.
Back-end:
Utilized ExpressJS to build a RESTful API for the back-end of the application.
Implemented the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations to handle the data flow between the front-end and the database.
Used HTTP Post requests to send data to the server and receive responses.
Defined endpoints to handle different API requests and return appropriate responses.
Database:
Used MySQL as the database management system to store and manage the movie review data.
Connected to the MySQL database using the appropriate drivers and library functions.
Executed SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, and utilized database transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability.
Deployment:
Deployed the application on AWS, utilizing Amazon's cloud computing services.
Configured AWS services such as EC2, S3, and RDS to support the web application.
Implemented AWS security measures to protect the website and the sensitive data.
Managed the infrastructure and monitoring performance of the application.

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for users to rate and review movies, offering a comprehensive and streamlined experience through the utilization of modern technologies including full-stack web development, database management, and cloud computing.
