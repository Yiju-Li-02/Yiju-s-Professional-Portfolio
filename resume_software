# Yiju Li

As a student at the University of California, San Diego, pursuing a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of both software and hardware development. I am proud to have had the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge through internships at companies such as Cloudgame and Ubtech. At Ubtech, I was able to contribute as a software engineer intern, where I worked on front-end development projects utilizing React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
